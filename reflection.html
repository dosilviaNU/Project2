Halfway done! I actually started to write this reflection last night as I felt inspired after revising Porject 2 to write a little bit about the feelings in regards to my writing ability this course has brought up, however that ended up being a 1500 word work in progress at 2am last night, so I think that will likely end up being my Project 4, so stay tuned for that it is a doozy. Oddly enough that reflection was actually not too far of the mark from the actual prompt. 
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
I think the biggest takeaway from the course so far has been my ability and willingness to write which I would file under goal number 7, I am much more interested in writing than when I came into this course, I don't think I am much better, but hopefully the renewed interest will spark a more dedicated approach to the craft going forward. 
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
The goal that I would like to work on more going forward would be goal number 11, the reflection I wrote last night was really addressing this, after reading the prompt for project 4 I think it is a good candidate for that project so I will wait to share all of my thoughts on that subject until then. 
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
All in all I am happy with the results of this course and its impact on my views towards writing, I hope to maintain this level of interest and continue to become a better writer as I grow into my new career.
